# Railboard API

This project generally is going to be the backend for my other project [railboard](https://github.com/StckOverflw/railboard), but the goal is to make an API
similar to the [bahn.expert API](https://github.com/marudor/bahn.expert) that marudor sadly shut down public support for and the documentation is not available any more.

**This Project is very WIP and far away from being completely functional**

## Goal of This Project

The Goal of this project is to make the public transport API's of the German Train Service ([Deutsche Bahn](https://www.deutschebahn.com/)) more accessible
to use in custom projects. The few open APIs the company offers are very limited and the effort to use the API's the Mobile Apps use is immense (source: trust me).

I think everyone that wants to build something cool should be able to. 

In addition to the REST API endpoints that I am building, the clients for the different APIs are completely usable without the rest of the Project.

## Documentation

Documentation will come soonâ„¢
